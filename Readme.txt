Hi folks,

Have u ever wanted touch control for touch screen application development.  Here is a small contribution from me.  I developed 2 control "touch2 - 2 buttons navigation" and "touch4 - 4 buttons navigation".  Source included enjoy.

When retrieving values from Database the sequence should be necessary to follow.  "Code,Description,Color,PicturePath"  to fill the buttons.  
Note: Touch2 can be changed to Vertical/Horizontal by changing the buttonstyle property at design time. doesn't support resize at runtime.

I haven't implemented Errorhandling in the control itself sorry about it.  If you want to know more about them pl contact me at sunadh@yahoo.com

The controls are free use just give me credits.

Last but not the least remember to vote for me.

Thank you
Regards

Program assumes ado reference and test.mdb in the same directly where application is running.
